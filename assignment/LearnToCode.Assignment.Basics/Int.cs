    // This is your assignment on integers
    // Integers are equivalent to rational/natural numbers in the programming world
    // But their values are limited
    // The most widely used integer type is int - a 32 bit signed integer
    // There also exist 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit signed and unsigned integers
    // In C#, variables of integer types are declared with the following keywords
    // 8bit: byte, sbyte
    // 16bit: short, ushort
    // 32bit: int, uint
    // 64bit: long, ulong
    public class Int
    {
        // You have to return 7 x 6
        public int TheKey()
        {
            return 0;
        }

        // You have to return the sum of the numbers a and b
        public int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
